This post isn't about how to install a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) on your website. If you are interested in learning, go to: https://www.taniarascia.com/https-ssl-tls-certificate-how-to/ This article is about why you need an SSL.

First, because your website is extremely vulnerable to hackers otherwise and that means your data is vulnerable. If you have other people's usernames and passwords on your website that makes you liable. Reduction of liability is _always_ smart.

Second, Google will dock your Search Engine Optimization (SEO) score if you don't have SSL and therefore your chances of other people seeing your content.

Third, not taking necessary security precautions on the internet means you either don't understand the risks of being online or don't care. Either way, you look bad.

Like anything, security costs money. Fortunately, however, you can obtain SSL certificates for free now. Check it out: https://letsencrypt.org/

If you are a developer, do this pronto. If you are not a developer but own a business or personal website, make sure your developer gets on this ASAP for you. It should only take an hour of work and it will potentially save you years of worry.
